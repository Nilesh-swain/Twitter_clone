# TODO: Fix 500 Internal Server Error on POST /api/post/create

## Completed Tasks
- Improved frontend error handling in `Frontend/src/utils/api.js` to show detailed error messages from backend
- Improved backend error handling in `Backend/controller/post.controller.js` createpost function to provide specific error messages
- Fixed frontend API request body to only include actual values (text and imgUrl) instead of placeholder strings
- Updated Sidebar component to show user full name and username on all screen sizes near the logout button
- Added dropdown menu functionality to sidebar user profile section with View Profile and Logout options
- Fixed image delete button in CreatePost component with better positioning and event handling
- **Fixed post deletion for posts with images** by adding graceful error handling for Cloudinary image deletion in `Backend/controller/post.controller.js`
- **Fixed home page scrolling layout** - Now only the middle posts section scrolls while sidebar and right panel stay fixed
- **Enhanced UI design and spacing** - Improved HomePage, CreatePost, Posts, and Post components with better spacing, larger profile images, enhanced hover effects, and more polished design

## Next Steps
- Test the post creation from frontend to see if detailed error messages are now shown
- Test post deletion for both text-only and image posts to ensure they work properly
- Test the new scrolling layout to ensure sidebar and right panel stay fixed while posts scroll
- Test the enhanced UI design and spacing improvements
- Check backend logs for any specific errors during post creation
- If error persists, investigate Cloudinary configuration or database connection issues
- Verify that the backend server is running and accessible on localhost:9000
